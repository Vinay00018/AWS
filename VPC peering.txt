vpc peering (establishing connection btw vpc's)

->It helps to transfer data btw private instances without exposing to internet(important data should not be exposed to internet)

* if vpc in different region or in same region or different aws account we can use vpc peering 

* vpc's must have different CIDR range otherwise it overlaps
