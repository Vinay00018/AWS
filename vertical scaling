Vertical Scaling in AWS means increasing the power of a single instance (like adding more CPU, RAM, or storage).

üß± Example:
You upgrade an EC2 instance from t3.small (2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM) to t3.large (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM).
You're not adding more instances ‚Äî you're just making one instance stronger.

‚úÖ Advantages:
Simple to implement.
No changes to application logic.
Good for monolithic apps.

‚ùå Disadvantages:
Downtime usually required to resize.
There's a limit to how much you can scale up.
Not suitable for high availability or fault tolerance.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Do Vertical Scaling in AWS:
Stop the EC2 instance.

Change instance type in the console.

Start the instance.

üÜö Horizontal Scaling vs Vertical Scaling:

| Feature         | Vertical Scaling        | Horizontal Scaling            |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Scaling method  | Upgrade instance size   | Add more instances            |
| Downtime        | Usually required        | No downtime                   |
| Cost efficiency | Less efficient at scale | More efficient at large scale |
| Max limit       | Yes                     | Can scale almost infinitely   |
