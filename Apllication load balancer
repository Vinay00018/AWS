In AWS, a Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (like EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses) to ensure:
‚Ä¢	High availability
‚Ä¢	Fault tolerance
‚Ä¢	Scalability

üß± Types of Load Balancers in AWS (via ELB)

1.	Application Load Balancer (ALB)
o	Works at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)
o	Smart routing: based on URL, host, headers, etc.
o	Best for web apps & microservices

2.	Network Load Balancer (NLB)
o	Works at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
o	Super fast, handles millions of requests per second
o	Best for gaming, real-time apps, or low-latency workloads

3.	Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
o	Works at Layer 3 (IP)
o	Used with 3rd-party appliances (firewalls, monitoring)
o	Best for security & traffic inspection tools






üîß Steps to Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

Step 1: Open EC2 Dashboard
‚Ä¢	Go to AWS Console ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí Load Balancers ‚Üí Create Load Balancer

Step 2: Select Load Balancer Type
‚Ä¢	Choose Application Load Balancer

Step 3: Configure Load Balancer
‚Ä¢	Name: my-alb
‚Ä¢	Scheme: Internet-facing (for public access)
‚Ä¢	IP type: IPv4
‚Ä¢	Listeners: Add HTTP on port 80

Step 4: Select VPC & Subnets
‚Ä¢	Choose your VPC
‚Ä¢	Select at least 2 public subnets (in different AZs)

Step 5: Configure Security Group
‚Ä¢	Create or select a security group
o	Allow inbound HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443)

Step 6: Configure Target Group
‚Ä¢	Target type: Instance (or IP/Lambda)
‚Ä¢	Protocol: HTTP
‚Ä¢	Port: 80
‚Ä¢	Health checks: Path = /, protocol = HTTP

üåê Step 7: Test on Internet
1.	Go to EC2 ‚Üí Load Balancers
2.	Copy the DNS name (e.g., my-alb-123456.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com)
3.	Paste in browser:
