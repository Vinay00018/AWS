1. (AWS EC2 User Data)
-> User Data in AWS EC2 allows running scripts automatically when an instance first launches. This is typically used for:

Installing software packages
Configuring the server
Running initialization scripts
How it Works?
User Data scripts run only once during the first boot It supports shell scripts (#!/bin/bash) and cloud-init scripts

Example: (A script to install Apache on an EC2 instance)

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "hello world" > /var/www/html/index.html

2. Security Groups (SG) in AWS
-> Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.

Key Features:
Works at the instance level (attached to EC2) Supports allow rules only (no deny rules) By default, all inbound traffic is denied and all outbound traffic is allowed

3. Network ACL (NACL [network address control list] ) in AWS
-> Network ACLs (NACLs) are firewalls at the subnet level, controlling traffic in and out of subnets.
-> initially inbound and outbound is denied for all traffic

Key Features:
Works at the subnet level Supports both allow and deny rules Evaluates rules in order (starting from the lowest numbered rule)

4.Elastic IP

-> Keep a fixed IP address for your application( server(ec2)) even if the instance behind it fails or restarts.
-> Remap quickly to another EC2 instance in the same region.
