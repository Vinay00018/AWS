###########  connect to private ec2 through jump server #########

1)change the directory to downloads folder

-> cd Downloads

2)use command to connect through ssh(terminal)

-> ssh -i p1.pem ec2-user@(paste public ip of jump srever) 

3) now we are in jump server
4)next we can connect to private ec2 

-> touch example.pem  (create .pem file and copy the .pem file of private ec2)

->ssh -i example.pem ec2-user@(paste private ip of private ec2)

->chmod 400 example.pem  (to change access to file)



|note| 

-> touch example.pem  (create .pem file and copy the .pem file of private ec2)

(this is not the best practice to coppy the file instead use command)

-> create any .pem file (ex.pem)
scp -i n.pem key.pem ec2-user@15.206.73.147:/home/ec2-user

     (n.pem=jump srever , key.pem=private ec2)

->after you can check in cd /home/ec2-user
->ls
->it shows ex.pem
