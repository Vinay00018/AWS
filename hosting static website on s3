🚀 Host a Static Website on AWS S3 (Sharing My Old Project to Help Beginners)

🗂️ 1️⃣ Created an S3 Bucket
I created a bucket named big-bucket-6-28-25 in the Asia Pacific (Singapore) region.
Note: Bucket names must be unique.

📂 2️⃣ Uploaded Website Files
I uploaded a basic index.html for the homepage and an error.html for error handling.
✅ Tip: Use the correct file extensions so S3 can serve them properly.

⚙️ 3️⃣ Enabled Static Website Hosting
In the Properties tab, I enabled Static Website Hosting, set index.html as the Index document, and error.html as the Error document.

🔓 4️⃣ Added Bucket Policy for Public Access
I added this policy to allow public read access:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::big-bucket-6-28-25/*"
    }
  ]
}
🌐 5️⃣ Tested the Website
I accessed the S3 website endpoint and the site worked perfectly — including the custom error page!
