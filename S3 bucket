### 5. AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) Notes

#### **1. Introduction to S3**
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is an **object storage** service in AWS.
- Stores data as **objects** in **buckets**.
- Highly **scalable, durable, and secure**.
- Used for **backup, big data, media storage, website hosting, and more**.

#### **3. S3 Lifecycle Rules**
- **Automates data transition** between storage classes.
- Reduces storage costs by moving **infrequently accessed data** to cheaper storage.
- Example Policies:
  - Move objects to **S3 Standard-IA** after 30 days.
  - Archive to **Glacier** after 90 days.
  - Delete objects after 365 days.

#### **4. Hosting a Static Website on S3 (Public Bucket)**
- Steps to host a static website:
  1. **Create an S3 bucket** (name must be globally unique).
  2. **Enable static website hosting** in bucket settings.
  3. **Upload website files** (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).
  4. **Make bucket public**:
     - Go to **Permissions** → **Bucket Policy** → Add a policy like:
       ```json
       {
         "Version": "2012-10-17",
         "Statement": [
           {
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Principal": "*",
             "Action": "s3:GetObject",
             "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
           }
         ]
       }
       ```
  5. **Access website using the S3 URL** (`http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com`).
